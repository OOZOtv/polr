Welcome to Polr's 2.0 development branch.
Please keep in mind 2.0 is currently unstable, and should not be used in production. 

Polr is an enterprise-class open-source link shortening web application designed to operate at many scales, built on the Software-as-a-Service paradigm. It allows you to host your own URL shortener, to brand your URLs, and to gain control over your data. Polr is especially easy to use, and provides a modern, themable feel.
